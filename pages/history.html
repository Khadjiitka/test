<h1>History of Skyrim</h1>

<p>Skyrim is a harsh, frozen land in the northernmost reaches of Tamriel. Its history is a tapestry woven from myth, war, the rise and fall of rulers, bloodshed, and heroic deeds. Among its icy peaks and stone valleys unfolded some of the most pivotal events in the history of Nirn.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>I. Mythic Era — Dragons and Creation</h2>
<p>The history of Skyrim begins not with humans, but with dragons.
    In the Mythic Era—when the world was still forming amid the clash between the Aedra and Daedra—Skyrim was part of a vast domain ruled by the mighty dragonkind, the children of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time.
    <br>
   <br>
   <b>The Dragon Lords</b> 
    <br>
    Dragons, blessed with immense lifespans and nearly limitless power, established their own empires. Over all others stood Alduin—the World-Eater—firstborn of Akatosh. Though later feared as a destroyer, in the earliest ages Alduin was revered by the Nords as a deity overseeing the cycles of life and rebirth.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>II. The Coming of the Nords from Atmora</h2>
<p> <b>The Great Migration</b>
    <br>
    Humanity arrived in Skyrim from the frozen northern continent of Atmora. The early humans were fierce and towering warriors, hardened by the eternal winter of their homeland. As Atmora fell into civil war and worsening climate, many fled under the command of the legendary leader Ysgramor.
    <br>
    They crossed the Sea of Ghosts and landed on the shores of present-day Skyrim.
    <br><br>
   <b>War Against the Falmer</b> 
   <br>
    The land was already inhabited by the snow-elves—the ancient and highly cultured Falmer. At first, they welcomed the newcomers, but soon war erupted. The exact cause is unclear, but most chronicles speak of the Night of Tears, when the Falmer slaughtered Ysgramor’s settlement.
    <br>
    Ysgramor gathered the Five Hundred Companions, returned to Skyrim, and waged the First War for Skyrim. The Falmer were driven deep underground, later enslaved by the Dwemer, and eventually transformed into the blind, twisted creatures known today as the Betrayed.
    <br>
    Thus ended the age of elven dominion in the North.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>III. War with the Snow Elves</h2>
<p>After Ysgramor’s victory, his sons and descendants established the foundations of Nordic civilization. The cities of Skyrim gained identity, rulers, and autonomy.
    <br><br>
    <b>King Harald — Father of the Nation</b>
    <br>
    Harald, a direct descendant of Ysgramor, became the first true king of the Nords. He renounced all claims to Atmora and proclaimed Skyrim the eternal homeland of his people.
    <br>
    Under his rule, Skyrim became a unified realm for the first time.
    <br>
    <b>The Great Expansion</b>
    <br>
    <i>The First Nordic Empire extended far beyond modern Skyrim:</i>
    <ul>
        <li>Windhelm as the ancient capital</li>
        <li>Whiterun and its plains as military strongholds</li>
        <li>Conquest of modern-day Morrowind</li>
        <li>Control over large parts of Cyrodiil</li>
    </ul>
    
    The empire eventually collapsed under the growing power of the Dunmer and their Tribunal.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>IV. The First Nordic Empire</h2>
<p>Before the fall of the First Empire, another great force dominated Skyrim: the Dragon Priests.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Dragon Cult</b>
    <br>
    The Nords adopted the local religious worship of dragons. The Dragon Priests ruled vast regions with power granted by dragon shouts. Magnificent temples—Sky Haven, Forelhost, Skuldafn, and Labyrinthian—stood as monuments to dragon supremacy.
    <br><br>
   <b>Tyranny</b> 
   <br>
    Over time, dragons began to dominate and enslave humans. Alduin demanded worship and sacrifices, ruling through fear and devastation.
    <br><br>
    <b>The War Against the Tyrants</b>
    <br>
    A rebellion formed, led by the Ancient Nords and three legendary Tongues. They used the forbidden art of the Thu’um—shouts—against the dragons.
    <br>
    To defeat Alduin, the Nords used the shout Dragonrend, forcing him through time into the distant future—the era of the Dragonborn.
    <br>
    The Dragon Cult collapsed, and its temples fell into ruin.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>V. The Age of the Dragon Cult</h2>
<p><b>The Middle Ages of Skyrim</b>
    <br>
Skyrim faced centuries of conflict:

<ul>
    <li>feuds among jarls</li>
    <li>akaviri invasions</li>
    <li>border wars with neighboring provinces</li>
    <li>the rise of necromantic cults</li>
</ul>
 

Despite the chaos, Skyrim preserved its individuality and warrior culture.
<br><br>
<b>Talos — The Birth of a God-Emperor</b>
<br>
In the Third Era, a great man arose in Skyrim—Tiber Septim, known as Talos.
<br>
<i>His feats:</i>
<ol >
    <li>Unification of Skyrim</li>
    <li>Conquest of High Rock</li>
    <li>Subjugation of all Tamriel</li>
    <li>Apotheosis as a divine being</li>
</ol>

Skyrim became a cornerstone of the Empire</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>VI. Dwemer and the Deep Kingdoms</h2>
<p>After the death of Martin Septim and the breaking of the Amulet of Kings, the Empire weakened.
    <br><br>
    <b>Ulfric Stormcloak</b>
    <br>
    Amid the turmoil, the Aldmeri Dominion banned the worship of Talos. This enraged the Nords, who saw Talos as their god and greatest hero.
    <br>
    Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm, rebelled, killing High King Torygg with the Thu’um. This began the Skyrim Civil War, splitting the province into:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Stormcloaks, fighting for independence</li>
        <li>Imperials, fighting for unity</li>
    </ul>
    
    The conflict tore the land apart.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>VII. The Era of Kings and Heroes</h2>
<p>According to ancient prophecy, Alduin would one day return to devour the world.
    <br>
    This prophecy came true. Dragons awakened, terrorizing Skyrim.
    <br>
    At this moment, the Last Dragonborn emerged—able to absorb dragon souls and wield the Thu’um as a natural gift.
    <br>
    The Dragonborn’s journey into Sovngarde and the final battle against Alduin ended the tyranny of the World-Eater.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>VIII. Skyrim and the Empire</h2>
<p>Today, Skyrim remains a land of:
<ul>
    <li>fierce warriors</li>
    <li>ancient barrows</li>
    <li>proud clans</li>
    <li>forgotten magic</li>
    <li>voices echoing through the mountains</li>
</ul>
    
    A realm where the past constantly walks beside the present, and heroes are born with each new age.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>IX. The Civil War</h2>
<p>Ulfric Stormcloak’s rebellion began with the death of High King Torygg. Half the land sides with Ulfric’s dream of independence; the other half fights for Imperial unity. Skyrim once again stands divided.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>X. The Return of Alduin</h2>
<p>In 4E 201, dragons returned. Alduin resurrected his kin, fulfilling the ancient prophecy of the World-Eater’s return. Only the Dragonborn could stand against him — a mortal with the soul of a dragon, wielding the power of the Thu’um.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>XI. Modern Skyrim</h2>
<p>Today, Skyrim remains a land of eternal frost and eternal heroes — where the past breathes through every ruin, and destiny waits on every mountain peak.</p>
